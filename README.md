# Basic networking
This is a _very_ simple example of using the MultiplayerSpawner and MultiplayerSynchroniser nodes.

## Running the project
The easiest option is to use the batch files, server.bat and client.bat.

Just edit them, and update the path to the Godot.exe to match your system.
> Note that the server runs a headless build, which doesn't display anything. You can remove the `--headless` argument from the server batch file if you want to see visuals on the server.

## Explanation
There's [a very quick youtube video](https://youtu.be/q-iXyA20A3Y) that covers how this project was made.
